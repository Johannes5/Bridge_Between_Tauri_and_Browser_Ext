create a transfer_prompt.md in a new folder docs/transfer
which can act as a prompt that is pasted in to the MapMap project (the original app that this projects acts as a minimal project for to test the new functionality of communicating browser sessions and allowing focusing/reopening depending on whether the browser has a tab open)
besides the transfer_prompt.md
there shoudl also be a docs/transfer/payload folder
it's what comes with the prompt to make use of the code that was written here
this payload folder will just be copied into the MapMap project. and the prompt will reference its contents
(it will live there until it is not needed anymore)
