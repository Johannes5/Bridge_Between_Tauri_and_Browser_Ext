# Quick Multi-Browser Test

## What Was Fixed

1. âœ… **Browser detection** - Now traverses process tree to skip `cmd.exe` and find the actual browser
2. âœ… **Extension error** - Fixed "unknown message type presence.status" error  
3. âœ… **Connection ID flow** - Properly routes connectionId through all message types

## Test Steps

### 1. Start Fresh

```powershell
# Make sure Tauri app is running
cd packages\app-tauri
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test with Comet

1. **Open Comet browser**
2. **Go to extensions** (comet://extensions/ or settings)
3. **Find your extension** and click **Reload** (ðŸ”„)
4. **Open extension console:**
   - Right-click extension icon â†’ Inspect
   - Go to Console tab
5. **Look for:**
   ```
   [bridge-ext] Connection established: Comet.exe (19a06...)
   ```
   (Should say "Comet.exe" not "cmd.exe" now!)

### 3. Check Tauri App

Should now show:
```
Current Window Tabs - Comet.exe
Connection: 19a06... â€¢ Last update: [time]
[Your Comet tabs]
```

### 4. Test Focus Button

1. Click **[Focus]** on any tab
2. **Should work!** - Tab should activate in Comet
3. No more "Target connection not found" errors

### 5. Test with Chrome (Optional)

1. **Open Chrome**
2. **Go to** chrome://extensions/
3. **Reload** your extension
4. **Check console:**
   ```
   [bridge-ext] Connection established: chrome.exe (19a07...)
   ```

### 6. Verify Multi-Browser

Tauri app should now show **TWO sections**:
```
Current Window Tabs - Comet.exe
[Comet tabs]

Current Window Tabs - chrome.exe  
[Chrome tabs]
```

## Expected Console Output

### Extension Console (Each Browser)
```
[bridge-ext] Connection established: Comet.exe (19a06a1dcfe-888c)
[bridge-ext] Connection established: chrome.exe (19a06a2f1ab-999d)
```

### Tauri App Console (Terminal)
```
[app] Connection registered: 19a06a1dcfe-888c (Some("Comet.exe"))
[app] Connection registered: 19a06a2f1ab-999d (Some("chrome.exe"))
```

## What Should Work Now

âœ… Browser names show correctly (Comet.exe, chrome.exe, etc.)
âœ… Each browser gets separate section
âœ… Focus button works (no "Target connection not found")
âœ… Save tabs works per browser
âœ… Restore tabs opens in correct browser
âœ… No "unknown message type" errors

## If Browser Detection Still Shows Wrong Name

The sidecar will print what it detected. To see it:

1. Close browsers completely
2. Open terminal
3. Run sidecar manually to see logs:
```powershell
& "C:\Users\Johannes\Documents\Programming\bridge workspace\packages\sidecar\target\release\bridge-sidecar.exe"
```
4. Should print:
```
[sidecar] Connection ID: ...
[sidecar] Browser: Comet.exe
```

If it still says cmd.exe, the browser might be launching the sidecar in an unusual way. You can override with an environment variable (but the fix should work now).

## Troubleshooting

### "Target connection not found"
- Means connectionId isn't being sent properly
- Check extension console for the connection ID
- Check Tauri terminal for registered connections
- IDs should match!

### Still shows "cmd.exe"
- The process tree detection might need adjustment
- Check what process is actually launching the sidecar
- Can use Task Manager â†’ Details â†’ Right-click sidecar â†’ "Go to details" to see parent

### Extension errors
- Make sure you **reloaded** the extension (not just refreshed the page)
- chrome://extensions/ â†’ Click reload button
- Check for any red errors in console
